Statistics produced by Tor Metrics
==================================

Tor Metrics aggregates large amounts of Tor network data and visualizes
results in customizable graphs and tables.  All aggregated data are also
available for download, so that people can easily plot their own graphs or
even develop a prettier metrics website without writing their own data
aggregation code.
