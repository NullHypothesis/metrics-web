Some notes on code style:

General:
- Lines do not exceed 74 characters unless things become really ugly.
- Files end with two newlines.

Java code:
- Indentation is two spaces in general and four spaces for continued lines.
- Imports are ordered alphabetically. Imports with different top-level
  package names or libraries (java, javax, org) are separated by an
  additional newline.
- Don't catch Exception, but the specific exceptions that can be thrown
  and that you can handle. Don't catch RuntimeException at all, but fix
  the code so that it doesn't throw RuntimeExceptions.
- Write comments as full sentences as in /* This is a comment. */
- Don't write your own util classes. Make use of Apache Commons instead.
- Qualify instance attributes and instance methods using this.

SQL code:
- All SQL keywords and PostgreSQL functions are written in capital
  letters.
- Never execute a query with SELECT * and expect the result columns to be
  in a specific order.

R:
- Add a space before and after '='.
