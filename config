## ERNIE performs its tasks in three phases:
##
## 1. Import files from the import/ directory that we didn't import yet
##
## 2. Download files that we want to learn about but didn't from importing
##
## 3. Write to disk what we learned
##
## Configuration options below are structured by these phases, starting
## with the data we care about and want to write to disk (3.), followed by
## the data we want to import (1.) or download (2.). Note that the default
## for downloading data is set to off!
############## TODO rethink this order

#### Data that we want to write to disk ####

## Write consensus stats to disk
#WriteConsensusStats 1

## Write dirreq stats to disk
#WriteDirreqStats 1

## Comma-separated set of countries to be included in dirreq and bridge
## graphs; note that after adding new countries, an import of the relevant
## descriptor archives (relay and/or bridge) is necessary!
#DirreqBridgeCountries bh,cn,cu,et,ir,mm,sa,sy,tn,tm,uz,vn,ye

## Comma-separated set of fingerprints of directory mirrors to be included
## in dirreq and bridge graphs; note that after adding new directories, an
## import of the relevant descriptor archives (relay and/or bridge) is
## necessary!
#DirreqDirectories 8522EB98C91496E80EC238E732594D1509158E77,9695DFC35FFEB861329B9F1AB04C46397020CE31

## Write bridge stats to disk
#WriteBridgeStats 1

## Write server descriptors stats to disk
#WriteServerDescriptorStats 1

## Comma-separated list of relay versions to be included in version-stats
#RelayVersions 0.1.2,0.2.0,0.2.1,0.2.2

## Comma-separated list of relay platforms to be included in
## platform-stats
#RelayPlatforms Linux,Windows,Darwin,FreeBSD

## Write directory archives to disk
#WriteDirectoryArchives 0

## Read cached-* files from a local Tor client
#ImportCachedRelayDescriptors 1

## Import directory archives from disk, if available
#ImportDirectoryArchives 1

## Keep a history of imported directory archive files to know which files
## have been imported before. This history can be useful when importing
## from a changing source to avoid importing descriptors over and over
## again, but it can be confusing to users who don't know about it.
#KeepDirectoryArchiveImportHistory 0

## Write relay descriptors to a database for later evaluation
#WriteRelayDescriptorDatabase 0

## JDBC string for relay descriptor database
#RelayDescriptorDatabaseJDBC jdbc:postgresql://localhost/tordir?user=ernie&password=password

## Import sanitized bridges from disk, if available
#ImportSanitizedBridges 1

## Import bridge snapshots from disk, if available
#ImportBridgeSnapshots 1

## Import torperf data, if available, and write stats to disk
#ImportWriteTorperfStats 1

## Download relay descriptors from directory authorities, if required
#DownloadRelayDescriptors 0

## Comma separated list of directory authority addresses (IP[:port]) to
## download missing relay descriptors from
#DownloadFromDirectoryAuthorities 86.59.21.38,194.109.206.212,80.190.246.100:8180

## Download and process GetTor stats
#DownloadProcessGetTorStats 0

## URL to download GetTor stats from
#GetTorStatsURL http://gettor.torproject.org:8080/~gettor/gettor_stats.txt

## Download exit list and store it to disk
