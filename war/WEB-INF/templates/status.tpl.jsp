        <h2>Tor Metrics Portal: Status</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>The network data collected by the Tor Metrics Project can be
        used to analyze the Tor network status from a few years ago until
        an hour ago. There are currently two applications for this data:
        The <a href="exonerator.html">ExoneraTor</a> tells you whether
        some IP address was a Tor relay at a given time, the
        <a href="relay-search.html">Relay Search</a> lets you search the
        descriptor archive for a relay, and the
        <a href="consensus-health.html">Consensus Health</a> summarizes
        information about the latest network consensus voting process.
        The <a href="log.html">Last Log</a> of the metrics portal software
        execution also falls under this category to evaluate how recent
        and complete the presented data are.
